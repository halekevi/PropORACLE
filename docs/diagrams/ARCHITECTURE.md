## C4 Level 1 — System context

Who uses PropORACLE and what external systems it depends on.

```mermaid

## C4 Level 3 — Flask API components

Internal structure of the Flask API container.

```mermaid
C4Component
  title PropORACLE — Flask API Components

  Container_Boundary(api, "Flask API · Python / Gunicorn") {
    Component(home,    "Home route",          "/  /api/run",          "Slate UI, pipeline trigger")
    Component(tickets, "Tickets route",       "/tickets /api/tickets","Goblin-70 first, graded-main mixer under")
    Component(grades,  "Grades route",        "/grades /api/grades",  "Hub iframe, graded props feed")
    Component(income,  "Income route",        "/income",              "P&L dashboard")
    Component(payout,  "Payout route",        "/payout",              "Multiplier, rate cards, log")

    Component(train,   "train_edge_model",    "scripts/",             "XGBoost retrain, temporal split")
  }

  Container(g70,     "Goblin-70 builder", "build_goblin70_tickets.py")
  Container(teval,   "Ticket eval",       "build_ticket_eval.py")
  ContainerDb(cache, "JSON Cache", "tickets_latest.json + eval HTML")

## Use case summary

### Actors

| Actor | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Bettor / Analyst | Person | Primary consumer — browses slate, tickets, grades, income, payout tools, and mobile app |
| Operator | Person | Runs pipelines, grades slates, retrains model, publishes artifacts; also browses as Bettor |
| Task Scheduler | System actor | Automated — triggers `run_daily.ps1` and grader on schedule |
| PrizePicks | External | Real-money entries happen here; PropORACLE only supports research and ticket building |

### Use case packages

| Package | Use cases |
|---|---|
| **Slate & research** | View home slate, browse by sport, hot players / consistency, model performance, export Excel |
| **Tickets** | Goblin-70 + mixer (latest), by date, EV & win-rate summaries, ticket backtest |
| **Grades & evaluation** | Grades hub, browse graded props, slate eval report, ticket eval report |
| **Income & tracking** | Income / P&L dashboard, grade history & sport breakdown |
| **Payout tools** | Estimate multiplier, rate cards & combo table, log observation, payout ladder, export logs |
| **Mobile app** | Remote Railway in Capacitor shell (canonical). Bundled `www/` + OTA are offline fallback only. |
| **Pipeline & ops** | Run step from UI, monitor job, daily / sport pipeline, grade slate, Goblin-70 --write-web, publish artifacts |

### Key `<<include>>` relationships

```
Run daily pipeline  ──includes──►  Run sport pipeline
Run sport pipeline  ──includes──►  Fetch PrizePicks slate
Run sport pipeline  ──includes──►  Enrich & rank props
Run sport pipeline  ──includes──►  Build combined tickets
Build combined tickets ─includes─►  Goblin-70 --write-web
Goblin-70 --write-web ──includes──►  Publish UI artifacts
Run daily pipeline  ──includes──►  Publish UI artifacts
Grade completed slate ─includes──► Publish UI artifacts
Run pipeline step (UI) ─includes─► Monitor pipeline job
OTA bundle update   ──extends───►  Verify deploy / health   (bundled fallback only; remote app skips OTA)
```

## Sport pipeline coverage

| Sport | AUC (2026-05-25) | Step8 join rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| MLB | 0.7268 | ~99.1% | Strong — name_aliases fix resolved join rate |
| NBA | 0.6175 | — | Watch |
| NBA1H | 0.4511 | — | ⚠ Below random on May slice — suppress or investigate |
| NHL | 0.6905 | ~38% | ⚠ Low join rate — backfill 13 dates (Feb/Mar) |
| Soccer | 0.7478 | — | Strong — Level 2 opponent context planned |
| WNBA | 0.6954 | — | CDP browser-first when `:9222` listening |
| Tennis | 0.6624 | ~4% | Step1 `--cdp` / `--fail-fast`; excluded from Jun-13 tree retrain |

**Overall model AUC:** see [CURRENT_STATE.md](../CURRENT_STATE.md) (production artifact may differ from May-25 holdout numbers above).

**Fetch note (2026-07-20):** Summer boards prefer **CDP-first** via `utils/prizepicks_cdp.py` when Chrome debug is warm; HTTP-only stacks hang on DataDome. Ops cadence: [guides/DAILY_OPS_OVERVIEW.md](../guides/DAILY_OPS_OVERVIEW.md).
